# Market Sentiment Analyzer  

## Project Description  
The **Stock Market Sentiment Analyzer** is a Python-based application that helps users determine the **current market sentiment** for any stock.  
It fetches **real-time news articles** using **NewsAPI**, processes them using **machine learning-based sentiment analysis**, and presents the results in a **Tkinter-based UI**.  

## Features  
- **Fetches Stock News**: Retrieves the latest news articles for any given stock using **NewsAPI**.  
- **Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis**: Uses a **Naive Bayes model**, trained on a **Kaggle dataset**, to classify news sentiment as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Tkinter**, the UI provides a clean and professional experience for users.

### How It Works

Application fetches real-time news about the stock.
Each news article is analyzed using a Naive Bayes sentiment model trained on a Kaggle dataset.
Sentiment result (Positive/Negative/Neutral) is displayed in the UI.
The top news articles are listed in a scrollable section for user reference.
